Project for the programming course in java.

Project about chess pieces:

      -There is an abstract "Piece" class representing a general piece element with an abstract getName() method that returns a value of type String.
      
      -There are three classes, inheriting from the Piece class, representing specific elements (chess pieces) appearing in chess.
      
      -The implementations of the getName () method should return a two-letter description of the piece.
      
      -The main class is "Chess" class, where the chessboard is stored in a two-dimensional array of abstract elements of the "Piece" type.
      
      -The first process of the program is to draw 5 elements (chess pieces) and place them randomly on a chessboard according to the general rules of chess.
      
      -The current state of the chessboard should be displayed in a simplified way that allow to know the situation of it.
